function [truepositive, falsepositive, falsenegative] = test(stride,D,D_detected,Ts,idx_missed, idx_less,U)
% detectionrates()
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function computes the TP, FP, TN, FN based on a true vector with
% detected meals D, and a computed vector with detected meals D_detected. 
% It uses a stride since the meal will be detected a time period after the 
% meals was given.
% It uses the indices for the true meals and the detected meals to compare
% if in the stride a meals should be detected or not and vise versa. 
%
% INPUT:
% stride            - The maximal time period it takes from the meal to be
% detected 
% 
% D                 - The true vector of real meals.
% D_detected        - The estimated vecor of 0 or 1. 1 meaning meals is
% detected
% U                 - Bolus insulin
% 
% Ts                - The time between control steps
% idx_missed        - Indicies for missed bolus when ingesting a meal
% idx_less          - Indicies for lessened bolus when ingesting a meal
% U                 - Insulin matrix
%
% OUTPUT:
% Four outputs being TP, FP, TN, FN
