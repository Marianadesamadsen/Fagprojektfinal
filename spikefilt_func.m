function Gfns_ctrlstate = spikefilt_func(Gm,Gfns_prev,delta_G)
% 
% spikefilt_func()
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% The function is a part of the GRID algortihm. This is part of the
% preprocessing section of the algortihm. The function filters the data
% using a noise-spike filter. This means the function will consider what
% data are extreme and what is not. Such that only extreme measurements of
% glucose will be consideret as meals in the GRID algorithm.
%
% INPUT:
% Gm         - The glucose measurement in the blood at the control state
% Gfns_prev  - The previous filteret measuret glucose in the blood
% delta_G    - The maximum ROC (rate of change)
%
% OUTPUT:
% The filtered value of glucose measured at the control state
